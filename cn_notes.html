    Q.1  What is the significance of Bridges? Explain the different types of Bridges. <br>
    Ans 1). The core structure of the bridge determines how it distributes the internal forces of tension, compression, torsion, bending and sheer . 
    While all bridges need to handle all those forces at all times, various types of bridges will dedicate more of their 
    capacity to better handle specific types of forces.
    Bridges are of two general types: fixed and movable. Fixed bridges are usually classified by 
    their basic geometry such as arches, trusses, beams, girder, suspension and cable stayed. ... 
    Suspension bridges, whose decks are suspended from cables and towers, are used in locations where it is difficult to place piers.

    Q.2 Explain the significance of Switching? What are different switching techniques used in computer networks? Discuss.
    <br>
    Ans 2). Switching refers to the process of determining the path via which our data packets will be sent. 
    When dealing with a large network or a very long-distance data transmission, we need the assistance of external hardware. 
    As a result, we need a specific path for our data packets to follow. <br>
    <b>Types of Switching:</b><br>
    1. Circuit Switching:
    Circuit switching is a switching method that creates a dedicated channel between the transmitter and the receiver. 
    <br>
    2. Message Switching:
    Message switching is a switching mechanism that transfers a message as a full and complete 
    unit and routes it through intermediate nodes which store and forward the message. 
    There is no specific path between the sender and recipient in the Message Switching method. 
    <br>
    3. Packet switching:
    Packet switching is a switching technique in which the message is split into smaller 
    bits and delivered separately rather than all at once.

    Q.3 Explain the differences between Pure and Slotted ALOHA Systems.
    <br>
    Ans 3). In Pure Aloha, any station can transmit data at any time. 
    In Slotted Aloha, any station can transmit data only at beginning of any time slot. 
    In Pure Aloha, time is continous and is not globally syncronized. 
    In Slotted Aloha, time is discrete and is globally syncronized.

    Q.4 Explain the working of CSMA Protocol. <br>
    Ans 4). Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) is a network protocol for 
    carriertransmission that operates in the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. 
    It senses or listens whether the shared channel for transmission 
    is busy or not, and transmits if the channel is not busy. 
    <br><br>
    Q.5 Describe the ARQ mechanism using suitable example.
    <br>
    Ans 5). ARQ stands for Automatic Repeat Request also known as Automatic Repeat Query. 
    ARQ is an error-control strategy used in a two-way communication system. 
    It is a group of error-control protocols to achieve reliable data transmission over an unreliable source or service. 
    These protocols reside in Transport Layer and Data Link Layer of the OSI(Open System Interconnection) model . 
    These protocols are responsible for automatic retransmission of packets that are found to be corrupted 
    or lost during the transmission process. 
    <br>
    <b>Working Principle of ARQ</b><br>
    The main function of these protocols is, the sender receives an acknowledgement from the receiver end implying 
    that the frame or packet is received correctly before a timeout occurs, timeout is a specific time period 
    within which the acknowledgement has to be sent by the receiver to the sender. 
    If a timeout occurs: the sender does not receive the acknowledgement before the specified time, 
    it is implied that the frame or packet has been corrupt or lost during the transmission. Accordingly, 
    the sender retransmits the packet and these protocols ensure that this process is repeated until the correct packet is transmitted.<br>

    Q.3 Describe IEEE 802.3,802.4 and 802.5  standards along with frame format for data-link layer technologies specifications. <br>

    Ans 3. <b>IEEE 802.3</b><br>
    The IEEE 802.3 standard determines the CSMA/CD access control protocol. The best known scheme for controlling a local area network on <br> a bus structure is carrier sense multiple action with collision detection (CSMA/CD).<br>
    <b>IEEE 802.4</b><br>
    IEEE 802.4 describes a token bus LAN standards.In token passing methods, stations connected on a bus are arranged in a logical ring.<br> 
    In this method only the station having token(token holder)is being permitted to transmit frames.<br>
    <b>IEEE 802.5</b><br>
    IEEE 802.5 describes the token ring standards. In a token ring a special bit pattern, called the token, circulates around the ring. <br> whenever all stations are idle.The sequence of token is determined by the physical locations of the stations on the ring.

    Q.1 Explain CRC code generation using example. <br>
    Q.2 What is bit and byte stuffing? Explain with example. <br>
    Q.3 Describe Go Back N and Selective Repeat ARQ protocol. <br>
    Q.4 Explain Checksum generation using example <br>
    Q.5 Write short notes on following: <br>
    1. Distance vector routing <br>
    2. Link State routing <br>
    3. Floyd Warshall algorithm <br>

    <br>Ans 1). <b>Cyclic Redundancy Check-</b> <br>
	Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is an error detection method. <br>
	It is based on binary division. <br>
    <b>CRC Generator-</b> <br>
	CRC generator is an algebraic polynomial represented as a bit pattern. <br>
	Bit pattern is obtained from the CRC generator using the following rule- <br>
    <blockquote> The power of each term gives the position of the bit and the coefficient gives the value of the bit. </blockquote>
    <b>Example-</b> <br> 
    Consider the CRC generator is x7 + x6 + x4 + x3 + x + 1. <br>
    The corresponding binary pattern is obtained as- <br>
    <img src="Media/crc.png" height="100" alt="CRC Example-"><br>
    Thus, for the given CRC generator, the corresponding binary pattern is 11011011. <br> <br> 

    Ans 2). Bit stuffing:
    <ul>
    <li>Allows frame to contain arbitrary number of bits and arbitrary character size. The frames are separated by separating flag. </li>
    <li>Each frame begins and ends with a special bit pattern, 01111110 called a flag byte. </li></ul>
    <img src="Media/Bit Stuffing.jpg" alt="Bit Stuffing"> <br>
    Byte stuffing:<br>
    •	In this method, start and end of frame are recognized with the help of flag bytes. Each frame starts with and ends with a flag byte <br>
    <img src="Media/Byte Stuffing.jpg" alt="Byte Stuffing"> <br> <br>

    Ans 3). <b> Key Differences Between Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat </b> <br>
    Go-Back-N protocol is design to retransmit all the frames that are arrived after the damaged or a lost frame. On the other hand, <br> Selective Repeat protocol retransmits only that frame that is damaged or lost. <br> <br>

    Ans 4). A checksum is a value that represents the number of bits in a transmission message and is used by IT professionals to detect <br> high-level errors within data transmissions. Prior to transmission, every piece of data or file can be assigned a checksum value <br> after running a cryptographic hash function.<br> <br> 
    <b>Checksum Example-</b><br>
    Consider the data unit to be transmitted is- <br>
    10011001111000100010010010000100 <br>
    Consider 8-bit checksum is used. <br> <br> 
     
    The given data unit is divided into segments of 8 bits as- <br>
    <img src="Media/checksum.png" alt="Checksum"><br>
    Now, all the segments are added and the result is obtained as- <br>
•	10011001 + 11100010 + 00100100 + 10000100 = 1000100011 <br>
•	Since the result consists of 10 bits, so extra 2 bits are wrapped around. <br>
•	00100011 + 10 = 00100101 (8 bits) <br>
•	Now, 1's complement is taken which is 11011010. <br>
•	Thus, checksum value = 11011010 <br> <br>
    

    Ans 5). <ol>
    <li>A distance-vector routing (DVR) protocol requires that a router inform its neighbours of topology changes periodically. <br> Historically known as the old ARPANET routing algorithm (or known as Bellman-Ford algorithm). <br> </li>
    <li>Link state routing is a method in which each router shares its neighbourhood's knowledge with every other router in the internetwork. <br> </li>
    <li>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between all the pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. This <br> algorithm works for both the directed and undirected weighted graphs. But it does not work for the graphs with negative <br> cycles (where the sum of the edges in a cycle is negative). </li> <br> <br>
