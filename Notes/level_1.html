</h1>
<h3>
	Hyper Text Markup Language
</h3> 
	HTML is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.<br>
	The component used to design the structure of a website are called HTML Tags.<br>
<h3>HTML Tags</h3>
	A container for some content or other html tags
<p> This is a paragraph! </p>
Here &lt p &gt is an opening tag while &lt/p&gt is a closing tag <br> 
And "This is a paragraph" is content <br>
Thus all these three together are called an element. <br>
<h3> Basic HTML Page </h3>
&lt !DOCTYPE html &gt - tells your browser that you are using HTML5 <br>
&lt html&gt - it is the root element of html document <br>
&lt head&gt  - it's the header of the page  <br>
&lt title&gt My First Page &lt /title&gt - it tells about metadata <br>
&lt /head&gt <br>
&lt body&gt - contains all data rendered by the browser <br>
&lt p&gt This is a paragraph &lt /p&gt - paragraph tag <br>
&lt /body&gt <br>
&lt /html&gt <br>

<h3>Quick Points</h3>
HTML tag is the parent tag of head & body tag <br>
Most of html tags have opening & closing tags with content between them <br>
While some tags don't have content between them eg- &lt  br&gt <br>
We can use inspect element/view page source to edit html <br>

<b>Note: HTML is not a case-sensitive language. It means:</b> <br>
&lt html &gt = &lt HTML &gt <br>
&lt /p &gt = &lt /P &gt <br>
